# MTS True Tech Champ 2025

Here I'll put, with the kind approval of challenge officials, original materials
for the problems - and later my solutions will be added for reference (after
the corresponding rounds are finished).

You can run simulator and solve problems locally - you'll need to download
`Weebots` and load the "world" provided in the task materials into it, then
write a robot control program in any language (it communnicates by network)
and watch your robot moving through the room/maze.

The first problem simply wants us to make robot moving through the fixed maze
of known geometry. We learn here that odometer and time-based solutions are not
reliable and learn to manage robot using lidar. Best solution works in 65 seconds.

The second problem requests us to make robot navigating the maze. It would be
simple but the robot is the same "physical" car as in the first problem so
it becomes quite challenging.
